This UDF exposes some of the SQL parsing and validation routines of
MySQL to the outside world. It basically enables you to parse and validate
a query, without being executed (similar to prepared statements... maybe
we should have used those?? hmm...).

At the moment, only SELECT, CREATE TABLE, DROP and ALTER (partially) are
supported. Further options need to be implemented... Queries are parsed
as multi-queries.

UDF returns NULL if no error is found or the MySQL internal error message.

WARNING: IT COULD BE THAT THIS UDF HAS UNKNOWN SIDE EFFECTS ON YOUR SERVER!
IT COULD BRING THE SERVER TO A CRASH, OR WORSE, BLOW THE WHOLE THING UP!
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! WE DON'T TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS. IT IS YOUR
PROBLEM IF YOU JUST INGEST SOME RANDOM CODE FOUND ON THE INTERNET INTO A 
SERVER DAEMON...
